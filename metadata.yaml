summary: '"Flora of the Sudan" by A. F. Broun and R. E. Massey is a scientific publication
  written in the late 1920s. This comprehensive work serves as a detailed catalogue
  of flowering plants found in the Sudan, featuring extensive sections on plant families,
  genera, and species, alongside vernacular names and economic uses. It aims to provide
  a systematic enumeration of the plant life in the region, incorporating contributions
  from a variety of botanists and previous studies.  At the start of the publication,
  the authors recount the development of their catalogue, mentioning initial efforts
  that occurred after the appointment of Broun as the Director of Woods and Forests.
  They discuss the collection of plant samples during numerous field trips, the assistance
  received from various individuals in documenting the local flora, and the evolution
  of the catalogue''s format over the years. The opening sets the foundation for a
  thorough investigation of botanical diversity while highlighting the collaborative
  work that made the publication possible. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
